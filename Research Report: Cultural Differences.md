## Introduction

It's undeniable that software development is incredibly important in this day and age. New software gets released left and right every day all over the world. This means people all across the globe are doing the same thing we are doing here at FHICT. People from all different cultures and backgrounds are typing and testing away everywhere. Just look at the amount of international students at our school who came here specifically to learn software development of any kind. Our current course is taught to us in English for this very reason; to avoid any cultural differences from getting in the way of the learning process, since English is the most spoken language in the world, especially by people in the IT business. Cultural differences shouldn't be ignored during the software development process, and here's why. 

## What are Cultural Differences?

First of all, I'll explain what these cultural differences are. Cultural differences are the as the name suggests, differences between different cultures. This can mean anything from spoken languages or dialects, their beliefs and religions, their morals and practices, and more. These tend to be unique to certain ethnic group. An umbrella term for these unique qualities is culture. An example is our own Dutch culture. Examples of the Dutch culture include our culinary staples like cheese, our fixation with sports like soccer/football and cycling, and our main religions being Roman Catholic and Protestant. Comparing these parts of our culture to, say, Greece, you'll see that they differ in these area's. For example, their cuisine is known for olive oil and wine, and their most popular religion being Christianity. These are cultural differences between The Netherlands and Greece. Obviously cultures don't differ in every aspect. We Dutch folk share our love of soccer with Greece. Cultures shouldn't be confused for stereotypes, however. Stereotypes tend to be an oversimplified image of something, while culture is a behavioral and moral pattern unique to an ethnic group. 

## Why do cultural differences in software?

You may be asking youself why these differences matter in the context of software development. The examples I gave above shouldn't matter in software development, right? While it is true that something like a culture's cuisine generally shouldn't matter during the development process, there are definitely other differences that should be taken into account. 

Last semester, I experienced first hand what impacts cultural differences can have on the software development process. For a little context, this was during the group project. I was in a group of seven people including myself, two of which didn't have a Dutch background. I believe both have a Syrian background, however I'm not 100% sure on this. I do know that both were muslims, though. This fact did play a role during the group project. This semester lasted from February to June, which meant that during the month of April, they took part in the Ramadan. The Ramadan is an event in which participating muslims start fasting for the duration of the month. Some muslims, however, do decide to eat late at night during this. I believe this was the case for these groupmates. Due to them staying up late, they would get a lack of sleep if they had to be at school at 9 in the morning, so they asked the rest of our group, and our semester coach, if it would be okay for them to be a bit later on the days when we worked on the group project during April. The agreement we ended up making wasn't very clear, as both parties had a different understading of it, which eventually lead to a somewhat heated discussion, which obviously had an impact on our project. It all ended up fine eventually, but as you can see, not taking these cultural differences into account (or not making clear agreements about them) can bottleneck the software development process.
