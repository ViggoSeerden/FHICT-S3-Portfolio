## Introduction

It's undeniable that software development is incredibly important in this day and age. New software gets released left and right every day all over the world. This means people all across the globe are doing the same thing we are doing here at FHICT. People from all different cultures and backgrounds are typing and testing away everywhere. Just look at the amount of international students at our school who came here specifically to learn software development of any kind. Our current course is taught to us in English for this very reason; to avoid any cultural differences from getting in the way of the learning process, since English is the most spoken language in the world, especially by people in the IT business. Cultural differences shouldn't be ignored during the software development process, and here's why. 

## What are Cultural Differences?

First of all, I'll explain what these cultural differences are. Cultural differences are the as the name suggests, differences between different cultures. This can mean anything from spoken languages or dialects, their beliefs and religions, their morals and practices, and more. These tend to be unique to certain ethnic group. An umbrella term for these unique qualities is culture. An example is our own Dutch culture. Examples of the Dutch culture include our culinary staples like cheese, our fixation with sports like soccer/football and cycling, and our main religions being Roman Catholic and Protestant. Comparing these parts of our culture to, say, Greece, you'll see that they differ in these area's. For example, their cuisine is known for olive oil and wine, and their most popular religion being Christianity. These are cultural differences between The Netherlands and Greece. Obviously cultures don't differ in every aspect. We Dutch folk share our love of soccer with Greece. Cultures shouldn't be confused for stereotypes, however. Stereotypes tend to be an oversimplified image of something, while culture is a behavioral and moral pattern unique to an ethnic group. 

## Why do cultural differences matter in software?

You may be asking youself why these differences matter in the context of software development. The examples I gave above shouldn't matter in software development, right? While it is true that something like a culture's cuisine generally shouldn't matter during the development process, there are definitely other differences that should be taken into account. 

First off all, and probably the most obvious possible barrier, is communication. A lot cultures have a unique language attached to them. Currently, the worlds most spoken language is English. I think it's pretty safe to assume that a lot of IT professionals and students can speak and understand at least a little English. Most coding languages were developed by English-speaking people, with English keywords for accessing the coding languages' features, after all. Even those developed in other countries, like PHP in Denmark or Python in The Netherlands, still use English keywords as opposed to Danish or Dutch keywords. There are some coding languages that do use keywords native to the creators' mother tongue, like the Arabic Jeem or the Chinese Wenyan, and localisations of existing languages also exist, like Teuton, which is a German Python, and Rouille, which is a French Rust, but even with these non-English coding languages out there, they aren't as widely used as industry standards. Aside from the coding language used, verbal communication with your colleagues is possibly an even bigger challenge to overcome. It's not just a matter of the used language, but also competence and pronounciation in said language. Not being able to understand eachother as colleagues is likely gonna become a huge obstacle to overcome before it's too late, which is easier said than done. Another thing to mention is time-zones. If you are working on a project in a team with members working from home in different parts of the world, time-zone differences are definitely going to affect communication. Not everyone will be reachable at the same times as you are, which can easily cause difficulties.

Aside from communication difficulties, behavioral and moral differences can have an impact on the development process too. Take for example Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory, which defines the following 6 dimensions of natural cultures:

- Power Distance Index (PDI): The extent to which unequal power distribution is accepted/expected.
- Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV): The degree to which people in a society are integrated into groups.
- Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI): The tolerance of uncertainty and ambiguity.
- Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS): The valuing of traditional masculin and feminin roles (assertiveness, courage, strength and competition vs. cooperation, nurturing, and quality of life)
- Long-term vs. Short-term Orientation (LTO): Whether the focus is on long-term or short-term success.
- Indulgence vs. Restraint (IND): The extent and tendency for a society to fulfill it's desires.

All of these dimensions can have an impact on software development to a certain extent. Take for example the Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI). Like mentioned above, the UAI indicates to what extent uncertainty should be avoided. One possible situation where the UAI could have an impact could be choosing the right development methodology, or in other words, making the right decision between the waterfall and agile methods. In societies with a high UAI (which means a low uncertainty tolerance), the waterfall method of working may be the better option due to it's more structured, predefined path to finishing a project, when compared to agile's more flexible way of working. Another example is the Power Distance Index (PDI), which is the acceptance of unequal power distribution. In societies with a higher PDI value, there may be a higher preference for a hierarchical team structure, which means having a team setup in which power is distributed unequally. This could translate to software development to having one person maniging the whole development process, and having different sections and teams within the project which also have one "leader" among them, as opposed to everyone having equal influence on the projects direction.

I think that the communication differences and behavioral/moral differences can have the biggest impact on software development, and the ones that should be addressed before any other differences. That's not to say that other cultural differences can't or won't have an impact, however. Last semester, I experienced first hand what impacts cultural differences can have on the software development process, despite this not seeming like a potential problem at first. For a little context, this was during the group project. I was in a group of seven people including myself, two of which didn't have a Dutch background. I believe both have a Syrian background, however I'm not 100% sure on this. I do know that both were muslims, though. This fact did play a role during the group project. This semester lasted from February to June, which meant that during the month of April, they took part in the Ramadan. The Ramadan is an event in which participating muslims start fasting for the duration of the month. Some muslims, however, do decide to eat late at night during this. If I remember correctly, this was the case for these groupmates. Due to them staying up late, they would get a lack of sleep if they had to be at school at 9 in the morning, so they asked the rest of our group, and our semester coach, if it would be okay for them to be a bit later on the days when we worked on the group project during April. The agreement we ended up making wasn't very clear, as both parties had a different understading of it, which eventually lead to a somewhat heated discussion, which obviously had an impact on our project. It all ended up fine eventually, but as you can see, not taking these cultural differences into account (or not making clear agreements about them) can bottleneck the software development process.

## How can we work optimally with these differences in mind?
