## Introduction

The software development process can be quite messy. Not having a clear view on what's done, what needs to happen, what needs refinement, who's working on what, and how the smoothly development is progressing can potentially be detrimental to the success of the project. It's because of this that staying organised and informed is a must for everyone working on your project. There are several software development methodologies you can follow during development to keep this organised structure throughout the duration of the project. My goal with this research is to get a better understanding of one of the most prominent methodologies out there: Agile.

## What is agile?

As mentioned above, Agile is one of several software development methodologies. Agile puts a big emphasis on flexibility, as opposed to something like the Waterfall methodology, which has a standard, structured path to follow during development. I think Agile is best explained through the Agile Manifesto, which defines the following four core values of Agile:

- Individual interactions are of more importance than tools and processes
- A working product is of higher urgence than thorough documentation
- Collaboration with the stakeholders rather than contract negotiations
- Capitalise on change instead of following a structured plan

You can get an idea of the extra flexibility Agile provides just from reading these values alone. It should be noted that the opposites of each value are still valued within Agile, but to a lesser extent. Aside from these values, the Agile Manifesto also outlines the following 12 core principles of Agile:

- Keeping the customer(s) satisfied throughout the project by continually delivering work
- Changing requirements are welcomed, no matter how late in a project. Harness change for a competitive advantage
- Deliver updated and working software to the customer regularly
- Assemble and work together with the project team and business owners on a daily basis
- Provide motivated individuals with the environment, trust and support they need to achieve their goal
- The best way to conveying information is through face-to-face communication.
- Working software is the most important indicator for progression.
- Maintain a constant pace for completed work
- Constantly focus on a high quality and good design
- Simplicity is key, and achieved by maximizing the amount of work not done
- Recognize that self-organising teams deliver the best work
- Regularly reflect with the team on how the process is going and adjust to increase efficiency where neccessary

## Why should agile be used?

## How can we apply an agile way of working?

There are several Agile methods that can be used during the development process. Here I have listed some of them:

- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming
- Crystal
- Lean Software Development
- Dynamic Systems Development Method
- Feature-Driven Development

I'll be explaining three of these methods.
