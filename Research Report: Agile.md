## Introduction

The software development process can be quite messy. Not having a clear view on what's done, what needs to happen, what needs refinement, who's working on what, and how the smoothly development is progressing can potentially be detrimental to the success of the project. It's because of this that staying organised and informed is a must for everyone working on your project. There are several software development methodologies you can follow during development to keep this organised structure throughout the duration of the project. **My goal with this research is to get a better understanding of one of the most prominent methodologies out there: Agile**. I do have some prior experience in using it, specifically with an agile framework called Scrum, but I don't have much experience with agile outside of that, not to mention the other agile frameworks out there and how they differ from Scrum. Expanding my knowledge about agile, and some of it's frameworks including Scrum subject may prove useful for future reference.

## What is agile and why should it be used?

As mentioned above, agile is one of several software development methodologies. Agile puts a big emphasis on flexibility, as opposed to something like the Waterfall methodology, which has a standard, structured path to follow during development. Other aspects of high importance within agile are communication and efficiency. Agile is best explained by the Agile Manifesto, which defines the following four core values of agile:

- Individual interactions are of more importance than tools and processes
- A working product is of higher urgence than thorough documentation
- Collaboration with the stakeholders rather than contract negotiations
- Capitalise on change instead of following a structured plan

It should be noted that the opposites of each value are still valued within agile, but to a lesser extent. Aside from these values, the Agile Manifesto also outlines the following 12 core principles of agile:

- Keeping the customer(s) satisfied throughout the project by continually delivering work
- Changing requirements are welcomed, no matter how late in a project. Harness change for a competitive advantage
- Deliver updated and working software to the customer regularly
- Assemble and work together with the project team and business owners on a daily basis
- Provide motivated individuals with the environment, trust and support they need to achieve their goal
- The best way to conveying information is through face-to-face communication.
- Working software is the most important indicator for progression.
- Maintain a constant pace for completed work
- Constantly focus on a high quality and good design
- Simplicity is key, and achieved by maximizing the amount of work not done
- Recognize that self-organising teams deliver the best work
- Regularly reflect with the team on how the process is going and adjust to increase efficiency where neccessary

## How can we apply an agile way of working?

There are several agile based frameworks that can be used during the development process, each with their own sets or standard principles and pracrices. Here I have listed some of them:

- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming
- Crystal
- Lean Software Development
- Dynamic Systems Development Method
- Feature-Driven Development

I wanted to get a better understanding of the Scrum method specifically, alongside two other agile frameworks. I chose Kanban and Lean for me to delve deeper into, and compare them to the Scrum framework to see what sets them apart.

### Scrum

Scrum is arguably the most popular agile framework out there, focussing on iteratively delivering value. Key elements of Scrum include splitting a project into several smaller iterations called sprints, which are typically abot 2-4 weeks each. At the end of each sprint, the team will look back on said sprint in a retrospective, discussing what wen't well and what didn't, while also planning what the next sprints goals will be. 

These goals tend to take the form of small tasks that, together, create the desired end product. In software, these are usually features of a piece of software. These small tasks are formatted as user stories, which describe the neccessary behavior and functions of the desired end product from the end users point of view. User stories provide an extra level of flexibility when compared to requirements, for example. This is because user stories don't define an immediate solution, set of tools, or any other details, but only the end result. User stories for a software project don't have to be features, though. They can also be bug fixes or non-functional aspects of an application. To estimate how difficult or how much time or effort a user story is going to take, story points are assigned to them. The higher the amount of story points, the more effort it will take to finish. These can be measured at the end of a sprint during the retrospective to find possible points of improvement for the development process. The progression of a sprint with user stories and story points can be visualised in a burndown chart, which shows the amount of work to be done (usually measured in story points) against the amount of time left in the form of a line graph, which also contains an "ideal" line for the sake of comparison. User stories can also be given acceptance criteria beforehand, which indicates an end result that should be met before the task can be seen as done.

To help with organising, a tool called a Scrumboard is used. These give an overview of every task that needs to be done, is being worked on, and is already done. Every task can be found in a list called the product backlog. At the start of each sprint, a sprint backlog is created, containing tasks from the product backlog to be done that sprint.   

The Scrum framework also defines roles for everyone involved. The development team is self-organising, as the Agile principles say. The product owner is the one who carries responsibility over the product. They can set priorities on tasks, steer the team in the right direction, and should be capable of making the right decisions on the spot. The scrum-master is a sort of coach for both the team and the product owner, helping everyone work optimally. They provide an overview and efficiency for the project. Finally, there's the stakeholders of the project. These can be either the customer base or the end users of your product. They are the ones who define the base user stories and direction of the project, while also providing feedback on the teams work.

Scrum puts an emphasis on communication between team members. I've already mentioned the retrospective, but Scrum also typically involves daily stand-ups, and possibly stand-downs, which are daily meetings led by the scrum-master and preferably held with the whole team present. During these, the team discusses what's going to be done, and what has been done previously, to get an idea of whether whatever has been worked on is going to be done in time. 

Finally, Scrum defines 3 pillars, those being transparency, inspection, and adaptation, which are supported by the 5 core values of Scrum:

- Commitment: Everyone puts their all into the project
- Focus: Everyone focuses on the tasks and goals of the sprint and team
- Openness: Everyone mutually agrees to be transparent about the circumstances around their tasks
- Respect: Everyone has mutual respect and trust for each other
- Courage: Everyone has the courage to make the right decisions and take on any task, no matter how daunting

### Kanban

Kanban is another popular framework, which is meant to define, manage and improve processes, and puts an emphasis of visualising these processes, and carrying them out one step at a time. Kanban defines 6 core principles:

- Visualise as much as possible, to help stay organised and provide transparency to the team
- Limit the workload at each time, to decrease the chance of confusion and stress and increase focus
- Manage the workflow, by visualising the project and limiting the workload, which in turn means the board is updated often
- Make explicit agreements, to establish default practices among the team
- Implement feedback loops in a timely manner, to improve the quality of the product
- Continuously improve and experiment, to evolve the team

The most important part of this framework is the Kanban board, which is how the process is visualised and optimised. A basic Kanban board consists of three categories: To Do, In Progress, and Done, with the In Progress section having a limit on how many tasks it can contain. More categories can be added, should this be neccessary. Every task is represented by a Kanban card, which is placed in one of the categories on the board. These cards contain information about the task it represents, such as a brief description or who is working on it, which helps with staying organised. This board is there to provide the whole team with information on across the whole project.

It differs from Scrum in a number of ways. The first being that Kanban doesn't make use of sprints or anything of the sort; it's all one continuous workflow. Kanban also doesn't require any role assignments to be done, as opposed to Scrum, in which every project needs at least a product owner, scrum master and development team. Finally, the practices differ. Scrum's default practices are all about looking back and planning the near future, which is done through the sprint backlogs, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews/retrospectives. Kanban's default practices reflect it's idealogy of process visualisation, with the Kanban board, alongside the limit on work-in-progress tasks, flow management, and feedback loops. 

### Lean Software Development

Lean Software Development, or LSD for short, is an agile framework based on the principles of Lean Manufacturing, and focusses on optimising development times and products, while eliminating waste and providing the product with neccessary inclusions. This way of working is also known as the Minimum Viable Product. LSD defines the following 7 principles:

- Eliminate waste, by e.g reducing workload, unneccessary code, performance bottlenecks
- Build quality in, by monitoring and judging quality as much as possible and wherever possible
- Create knowledge, by encouraging practices like pair programming and code reviews
- Defer commitment, by keeping the option to alter anything as much as possible in the case of an inapplicable product
- Respect people, by empowering colleagues and providing them with a level of freedom and authority
- Optimize the whole, instead of optimising on a smaller level
- Deliver fast, by splitting tasks into smaller ones for faster completion and easier problem detection

Aside from these principles, there are five Lean Manufacturing practices that can be used to effectively apply LSD. The first of which being identifying value, which is done from the end users point of view, and is defined by what the customer is willing to pay for. Next is mapping the value stream, which means laying out a plan to delivering a feature or update, after the value has been defined and turned into a tangible goal. This is followed by creating a flow, or spotting and fixing potential bottlenecks in the process of development and delivery, usually done through visualisation. Then comes establishing pull, which means only doing what needs doing, and when it needs doing. Finally comes seeking perfection, which means repeating and reviewing the whole development process continuously.

LSD differs from Scrum in that it focusses more on optimising the ongoing process by reducing waste, while Scrum is more centered around working in smaller iterations planned out beforehand, and creating a user-centered product. The scale on which it is implemented is also different. Scrum is implemented on a team-by-team basis, while LSD is a company- or project-wide implementation.

## Conclusion

So, I found that agile mainly focusses on flexibility and communication, and it defines 12 principles that support this ideology. There are a multitude of agile frameworks which define their own set of principles as wel, while also having their own standard tools and practices to help with what these frameworks set out to achieve. I found that Scrum puts an emphasis on incrementally delivering value, and keeping the team productive and communicative as shown by it's 5 core values. It uses roles and practices like daily stand-ups and sprint reviews to keep the communication within the team going. Kanban is centered around optimalisation by visualising as much as possible, which in turn optimises the development process. Lean Software Development (LSD), inspired by the principles of Lean Manufacturing, also puts a focus on optimising an existing process, by concentrating on eliminating waste. Kanban and LSD differ from Scrum in their ideologies, principles and standard practices. All of these frameworks have their own ways of abiding to the idea behind agile.
